=============================

BUILDING:

	A Makefile is provided in the project root. 
	run 'make' to format, build, and install.

	The binary generated is 'bin/timeserver'.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

~/class/tacticalsoftwareengineering/go_workspace/assign1$ bin/timeserver
Timeserver listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
localhost:8080 - [Mon, 12 Jan 2015 18:26:02 -0800] "GET /time/ HTTP/1.1" 200 -
localhost:8080 - [Mon, 12 Jan 2015 18:26:09 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 -
localhost:8080 - [Mon, 12 Jan 2015 18:26:19 -0800] "GET /shouldbe404 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
localhost:8080 - [Mon, 12 Jan 2015 18:26:30 -0800] "GET /time/urlresolutionbug HTTP/1.1" 200 -
^C

BUGS:

	URLs that are prefixed with '/time/' are still recognized as valid.
	For instance, '/time/notvalid' still returns the time and 200.
